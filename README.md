## Branching and PR's

1. Each branch should be related to a Jira issue and follow the next pattern: PROJECT_NAME-ISSUE_NUMBER-title
   Example: NFTPAR-959-automation-testing
   Title have to be minimalistic info about what branch is about, it doesn't have to be exact copy of jira issue (but usually will be)
2. If multiple tasks are done in single PR you can specify other tasks in commit messages following same pattern (you can abandone task title, since you already have commit message)

## ToDo
